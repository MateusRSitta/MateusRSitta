## Hi, I'm Mateus Sitta!

### How just one line of code can make a difference?

When I discovered software development, I was impressed with the power of making a difference that a little bit of code had and that's when I wanted to be a part of it.
Javascript was the language for me, mainly because of React and Node.js...
I started creating my own projects and didn't want to stop since then.
And now, I'm looking to learn more about development and technology!

And if you're looking for it too, let's connect!
